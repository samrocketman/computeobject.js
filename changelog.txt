v0.2-0.3 10/20/2010
1.	Fixed bug where (200e-6)/(2.2*(10e3)) was a false positive of an improper equation.  Regular expression for
	compute.test.e() was modified to fix bug.  Also 4e-3 and 4e+3 were false positives for flagging an improper 
	equation.

v0.1-v0.2 10/02/2010 (mm/dd/yyyy)
1.	Fixed bug where x/0 was not correctly handled which led to equation result inconsistencies.  Can't divide 
	by zero.
2.	Fixed bug where sin(0)^2 was not correctly handled by formatEquation function giving and incorrect 
	sinMath.pow((0),2) function.
3.	Fixed bug where domain of ln(x) was not properly handled producing and inconsistent NaN result from 
	compute.result function.
4.	Fixed bug where 2^3^2 (multiple levels of powers) were not correctly calculating.
