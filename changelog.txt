ChangeLog
05/06/2010 (mm/dd/yyyy) is when initial creation of this object began.
05/17/2010 (mm/dd/yyyy) is when the public source of this object is released.

v0.4-0.5 11/09/2010
1.	Added compute.groupEquation().  compute.groupEquation("ln(3)+3") returns "(ln(3)+3)".  This way further
	operations can be applied to the whole equation.

v0.3-0.4 10/28/2010
1.	Finished commenting end of functions and objects so that a function map can easily be generated.
2.	Fixed bug in regex in compute.test.check_denominator() which caused compute.result() false positive detect
	1/e^(1) as dividing by zero including all x/e^(y).
3.	Fixed bug in compute.changeSign() where -(2*ln(3)) returned -(-(2*ln(3))) when it SHOULD return 2*ln(3).
	This happened with all trig functions.


v0.2-0.3 10/20/2010
1.	Fixed bug where (200e-6)/(2.2*(10e3)) was a false positive of an improper equation.  Regular expression for
	compute.test.e() was modified to fix bug.  Also 4e-3 and 4e+3 were false positives for flagging an improper
	equation.

v0.1-v0.2 10/02/2010
1.	Fixed bug where x/0 was not correctly handled which led to equation result inconsistencies.  Can't divide
	by zero.
2.	Fixed bug where sin(0)^2 was not correctly handled by formatEquation function giving and incorrect
	sinMath.pow((0),2) function.
3.	Fixed bug where domain of ln(x) was not properly handled producing and inconsistent NaN result from
	compute.result function.
4.	Fixed bug where 2^3^2 (multiple levels of powers) were not correctly calculating.
